            Hello! My name is Gen Yamaguchi Butler. <br><br>I am a photographer and I explored the story of Spirited Away through this medium. <br><br> If you havent watched Spirited Away yet, I highly recommend it as a must-watch masterpiece of animated storytelling. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, it is a captivating journey filled with wonder, magic, and profound themes that resonate with audiences of all ages. <br><br> As a photographer, I was inspired by its rich visuals and narrative to capture its essence through my lens. <br><br> I used techniques of composition such as leading lines and a subtle frame to guide the viewer using the beams of sunlight, and the trees which surround the subjects of the image: the Temple Gate, and the two mysterious figures right below it. <br><br> Those two figures represent the spirits in the spirit realm near the start of the movie when Chihiro runs through the realm right during the transition from dusk to night for her safety. This safety is a narrative brought to life through the warmth of the scenery, but the danger and uncertainty is represented through those figures.
